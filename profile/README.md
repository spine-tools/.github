## Spine Project

The main objective of the Spine project is to develop and validate an end-to-end energy modelling toolbox that will enable open, practical, flexible and realistic planning of future European energy grids.

### Community :speech_balloon:

To connect with other users, to identify problems and exchange experiences, we will organize monthly early-user meetings for Spine Toolbox and SpineOpt. The meetings will be held every last Wednesday of the month at 10am CEST [:calendar: ics zip](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl/files/9149471/Spine.Toolbox.and.SpineOpt.Exchange.QA.Help.zip) and can be joined [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_YjlhOWNmZjYtMDUxMC00MWViLTllMGUtNGI0NWY5NzY2YTU4%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d7ab8571-7881-415a-b0c2-b5a933c86ee8%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%227ff67982-a736-42fa-ade6-994bb97d94a8%22%7d).

### Repository overview :file_folder:
[**Spine Toolbox**](https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox) is an open source software to manage data, scenarios and workflows for modelling and simulation [(docs)](https://spine-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#). You can have your local workflow, but work as a team through version control and SQL databases.

[**SpineOpt**](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl) is a Julia-based open source energy system modelling framework capable of planning and scheduling energy and power systems with high level of temporal, spatial and technological adaptability [(docs)](https://spine-project.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/index.html).

[**SpineInterface**](https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineInterface.jl) allows to rapidly build optimization models for the Julia JuMP environment using Spine Toolbox as the data, scenario and workflow management tool [(docs)](https://spine-project.github.io/SpineInterface.jl/latest/index.html).
