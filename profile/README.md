## Spine tools

Spine tools make modelling easier by providing a workflow management tool that cares about data and scenarios called [**Spine Toolbox**](https://github.com/Spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox). Spine tools also include a feature rich energy system model [**SpineOpt**](https://github.com/Spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl) and a really convenient package for building new optimization models [**SpineInterface**](https://github.com/Spine-tools/SpineInterface.jl).

## Development

The main development resource for Spine tools is currently EU project Mopo (1.1.2023 - 31.12.2026) with a focus on creating data pathways for all energy sectors, increased usability as well as computational speed. Originally Spine tools were created in EU project Spine (2017-2021) with the aim to develop and validate an end-to-end energy modelling toolbox that will enable open, practical, flexible and realistic planning of future European energy grids.

### Community :speech_balloon:

To connect with other users, to identify problems and exchange experiences, we will organize monthly early-user meetings for Spine Toolbox and SpineOpt. The meetings will be held first Tuesday of every month at 3pm CEST ðŸ“† [(ics zip)](https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl/files/10497817/Spine.Toolbox.and.SpineOpt_.Exchange_.Q.A_.Help.zip) and can be joined [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MTA4MTZmMjMtNzk0ZS00ZjFkLWFjZjEtODVhNDc3Yjg5MjBj%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22021f8f00-6328-4916-b79c-b49b9a19a7d6%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22f45e2eeb-78d8-4230-903d-49e42a141be3%22%7d).

### Repository overview :file_folder:
[**Spine Toolbox**](https://github.com/Spine-tools/Spine-Toolbox) is an open source software to manage data, scenarios and workflows for modelling and simulation [(docs)](https://spine-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#). You can have your local workflow, but work as a team through version control and SQL databases.

[**SpineOpt**](https://github.com/Spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl) is a Julia-based open source energy system modelling framework capable of planning and scheduling energy and power systems with high level of temporal, spatial and technological adaptability [(docs)](https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineOpt.jl/latest/index.html).

[**SpineInterface**](https://github.com/Spine-tools/SpineInterface.jl) allows to rapidly build optimization models for the Julia JuMP environment using Spine Toolbox as the data, scenario and workflow management tool [(docs)](https://spine-tools.github.io/SpineInterface.jl/latest/index.html).
